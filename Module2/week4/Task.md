## The Problem Healthline is Addressing:
- Patients need a way to easily access health professionals that doesn’t require travel so they can receive care a lot quicker 
- Patients need a way to see a doctor using more flexible ways so they can get the care they need when they need it in line with their lifestyle and schedule. 
- Doctors need a way to access patients in more remote areas that can’t easily get to a hospital so they can help more people
- Patients need a way to access their health records in one place so they can easily share that information when they see a new doctor. 
- Patients need a way to track health activities such as when to schedule annual checkups, when to have a lab re-done, etc. so they can proactively practice preventative care. 
- Patients need a way to see personalized health reminders such as dietary recommendations based on diagnosis, physical activity checkpoints, etc. so they can make better lifestyle decisions regarding their health. 
- Patients need a way to record symptoms they are experiencing so they can provide doctors with accurate information regarding overall wellbeing. 
- Doctors need a way to see a comprehensive repository of patient records so they can provide well-informed recommendations when seeing patients. 
- Patients need a way to safely share health information with their sponsors so they can validate the care they are receiving. 
- Sponsors need a way to see specific patient health information so they can better understand the care their loved ones are receiving 
- Sponsors need a way to schedule and manage medical care for their loved ones that are unable to, such as elderly parents, etc. so they can feel more empowered and have more control over their health outcomes. 
- Doctors (international) need a way to provide advisory support to members of their communities in Africa so they can help close the gap in healthcare that some areas are facing. 


## Design Process of Healthline
### Prototype Design
After investigating what other telehealth applications were providing and measuring it against the needs our users required, a minimum viable prototype (MVP) was created based on all the learnings and opportunities uncovered. This MVP is split into 5 major navigational areas: Home, Consult a Doctor, Symptom Checker Help, Remote Patient Monitoring, and Medical Q&A. And also with the Sign Up/Log In Nav. Below is a more indepth view of each screen and the functionalities they provide.

### Home 
The Home screen is where the patient starts their journey. It is a dashboard for all pending patient activities such as upcoming appointments, reminders for prescription refills, resources, etc. This screen is also the first access point in obtaining care and satisfies the first patient need of easy access to affordable healthcare providers. It talks about the specialty of medical services Healthline offers, like Sexology, General Physician, Dermatology, Psychiatry, Stomach and Digestion, Pediatrics and Urology. And other details about Healthline and our top physicians.

### Consult a Doctor
Consult a Doctor is a nav and page that will need the users to sign up or log in before accessing the page. The nav will have 2 different categories that are with the mode of consultation( i.e chat with a doctor, phone a doctor and video consultation) and the second category is the type of service needed (urgent care, virtual appointment, homecare visit).

### Symptom Checker
Healthline Symptom Checker is used to identify possible diagnosis for user health-related concerns. And then mark the user's symptoms to get a possible list of conditions to help understand the causes and treatments, before being passed on to a doctor.
The doctors will send a relevant reply related to the user’s symptoms and provide further advice regarding treatment.

### Remote Patient Monitoring
This will be a page for doctors to monitor the health of their patient remotely with physical visitation.

### Medical Q&A
This will be a page for medical questions and all the answers will be published on the page. The answers are written by Verified medical doctors, therapists and health experts. The Content will be moderated by the Healthline medical review team before publication.

## Competitor Analysis
As the idea of telehealth is widely popular in the world. Healthline is bound to face competitors in the industry. With over 900 healthcare companies in Africa, I investigated the ones that aligned the most with the mission and business model of DoctorNow. The top 5 companies I found that most aligned are Antara (Kenya), Bima Health (Ghana), Bisa (Ghana), CribMD (Nigeria) and Zuri (Kenya). 

Antara Health is a telehealth application that provides virtual primary care, care coordination for in person hospital visits, health management programs for when ongoing care is needed, and preventative care. They are very similar to Healthline with Telemedicine offerings but differ when it comes to in-person care. Patients have expressed the need for in-home care especially for those that are too sick or old to travel to a hospital or clinic. Antara provides coordination with your existing doctor at a hospital, booking appointments and obtaining referrals, but does not offer in-home care. 

Bima Health is a mobile delivered health and insurance provider based in Ghana for emerging markets. They offer access to doctors (via WhatsApp and SMS), medication support, access to health records through their application and insurance coverage if their customers need to stay in a hospital. Like Antara, Bima does not offer home care as part of their services. 
Bisa is a health application based in Ghana that provides the public access to medical advice and healthcare information using the mobile phone. Like Healthline, Bisa provides virtual medical care and advice for people that are unable to visit the hospital for various reasons such as cost, long queues, and the fear of stigmatization. How Bisa differs from Healthline is it’s primarily a health resources application providing tips and articles on different health categories with the added ability to ask a question to doctors in the form of a chat. There is no ability to have a real time video call or phone call with a doctor if there is an emergency. There is also no ability for care continuity with a specific doctor to really get deep into the issue being faced and follow up over time. 

CribMD is a digital health consultation platform based in Nigeria. They provide telemedicine, doctor home visits, online pharmacy with prescription delivery as well as health plan subscriptions. CribMD fulfills most of the needs our user asked for. They are solely based in Nigeria and only take Naira in currency making it difficult for family members abroad to provide financial support to their loved ones back in Africa directly through their app. 

Lastly, Zuri Health is a mobile app based in Kenya that helps patients access and book affordable and accessible healthcare services on demand based on availability, location, and specialization. They offer virtual doctor’s visits, at home care visits, as well as direct appointments to nearby hospitals, labs, and pharmacies. Zuri is also very similar to Healthline but like CribMD, it is based solely in Kenya and making it difficult for family members abroad to provide financial support to their loved ones back in Africa directly through their app.

## Barriers of entry the market
It would be irresponsible and costly to overlook some challenges faced in the Telehealth industry. Also, the market in Africa is still being faced with some infractures challenges i.e the infrastructure as it is now cannot fully handle such telehealth platforms across all regions of Africa. There is still a long way to go, and technology is still developing and expanding at slow rates in the rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. Mobile applications in general still face significant challenges related to poor network service, inconsistent access to electricity, malfunctioning phones, and a lack of resources necessary to secure maintenance and incessant subscription. Legal and regulatory hurdles, security breaches which can lead to leaking of confidential information. These issues are unavoidable but can improve patient outcomes when coupled with two other interventions proposed by McKinsey of employing community-based health officers who provide essential primary care at the village level and creating networks of mobile health clinics that transport diagnostics and other technologies to remote places. Together with telemedicine, these approaches can save many lives at a relatively low cost.


## Conclusion of the analysis
The analysis has confirmed the necessity of a telemedicine product that can meet the medical needs of the population in sub-Saharan Africa and their families in the diaspora. Given the market size and the growth the market is meant to experience in the next few years. The analysis has shown that the need for telemedicine products is growing. These needs include a flexible telehealth platform connecting patients to doctors anywhere and anytime that adapts to different network environments and bandwidths. In addition to that, participants need a way to support their loved one's medical care, whether financially by providing payment for services or intellectually by providing feedback and advice on steps to take moving forward in their medical plan. Analysis also expressed health metrics and tracking of medical information in one place as a need for preventative care. Although the analysis is not perfect, it is needed. It serves as a starting point in the journey to create a long-lasting healthcare solution in sub-Saharan Africa.

Telehealth was once limited only to rural or remote communities but is now increasingly used to expand the geographic reach of health care services and improve access to care. Factors such as convenience, efficiency, communication, privacy, and comfort have been identified by patients as important to use telehealth. Telehealth includes a wide range of practices and specialties and involves interactions among patients and providers through telephone, e-mail, video chats or conferences, the Internet, and remote devices. Patients equipped with smartphones, tablets, laptop computers, and desktop computers can readily use telehealth applications to link them with health care practitioners who can potentially diagnose, monitor, and treat a multitude of acute and chronic conditions. Along with such technological advances, approval and acceptance are increasing because telehealth is an efficient and effective tool for improving health care access and outcomes.
