Scrum is a software product development framework that helps an organization (mostly software company) address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value to their customers. Scrum is a subset of Agile methodology.

Some of the benefit of Scrum in software development are;

* Clear Team Roles
In a Scrum Team, everyone understands their role and what responsibilities this entails. This is an excellent safeguard – nothing gets missed.
It also creates a tightly-knit, high-performing team. Each member trusts that the others will carry out their roles and communicate if any assistance is required.
* Lower Risk
The combined elements that make Scrum more communicative, flexible, and productive make it a lower risk project. Risk can be easily avoided and mistakes can easily be corrected with scrum.
* Flexibility
Scrum is a project management methodology designed to respond easily and positively to change. With conventional project management methods and management courses, changing requirements can be a nightmare to handle. Is the opposite with approaches like Scrum and its parent methodology, Agile. They are designed to be responsive at all stages in a project’s life cycle.
* Fast & Frequent Value
In a Scrum project, value is delivered to the stakeholders (often customers) early on and throughout the project’s lifecycle. Unlike other methods, customers can be enjoying the product while the scrum team is improving the product, debugging and finishing the product to be launched in full.

* Transparency
Transparency is one of the 3 Pillars of Scrum, the foundational principles upon which the rest of Scrum is built. Different elements within a Scrum Sprint (project cycle) help to uphold this pillar. The Scrum Board displays ongoing tasks and their progress, the Daily Standup Meeting provides an opportunity to flag any obstacles, and the Sprint Planning and Review clearly outline the priorities and achievements of the Sprint respectively.

UX Design is a term used to describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context.

What a UX designer does is to make sure every user’s interaction or experience with a product or service goes smoothly. And they perform their duties through user research, user research analysis, preparing a user persona & user flows, wireframes & prototype, and user testing.

UX is different from other design fields  because other design fields focus on visual elements and visual design. While UX designers take a broader perspective by focusing on the entire interaction between a user and a product.

### Gloria Lo Portfolio
Gloria has nailed her designer introduction with a three-tiered approach. First, she treats us to a bold, eye-catching headline that describes her in terms of her favorite activities.
Gloria was able to convey the most important information while managing the delicate art of brevity. That is very brave of her and very professional.

Gloria's portfolio also features a comprehensive “About” page, complete with a video, a section detailing her values (with the help of emojis), a very thorough testimonial from a former employer, and links to her music and artwork.

Gloria can still work more on her  portfolio homepage since it will be the first place the users will visit. She can move content to make it more and more explanatory.

### Olivia Truong Portfolio
Olivia’s portfolio demonstrated how she identifies and tackles a variety of user problems. Olivia’s portfolio does a great job of this.

Gloria’s portfolio took the problem personal and empathy-driven, which is a critical part of being an UX Designer.

UX designers are problem-solvers, so Olivia’s portfolio did a good job reflecting that.

Olivia can talk more about herself and put some projects she previously worked on, the problems she faced and how she tackled them.
