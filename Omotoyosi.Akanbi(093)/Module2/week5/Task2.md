## List of Metrics to be used to measure Healthline are;
* Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Daily Active Users (DAU)
* Customer Conversion Rate
* Churn & Customer Retention Rate
* NPS & CSAT Score
* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

* Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Daily Active Users (DAU): DAU is the number of unique users who engage with your product in a one day window. And why, MAU is the number of unique users who engage with your product over a 30-day window (usually a rolling 30 days). The ratio of DAU to MAU is the proportion of monthly active users who engage with your product in a single day window. DAU and MAU are a great overview of a digital product’s overall health.

* Customer Conversion Rate: Customer conversion rate is the percentage of potential customers who take a specific desired action. In e-commerce or online marketing, it refers to the percentage of website visitors that perform a specific desired action on the website or landing page. The conversion action is usually a quantifiable action capable of turning a prospective customer into a paying customer.
The customer conversion rate is a metric that measures the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, website designs, salespeople, and other sales tools.

* Churn & Customer Retention Rate: churn rate refers to the number of customers you've lost over a time. And retention rate is the ratio of customers that return to do business at your company. A company with a high churn rate would, by default, have a lower retention rate.
If you have a high churn rate, it means that your product isn’t delivering what it promises. On the other hand, a low churn rate shows that your user base is loyal, and likes your product at least enough to stick with it.

* Net Promoter Score (NPS) & Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT): CSAT measures customer satisfaction with regards to a product or service, whereas NPS is best used to measure the overall relationship the customer has with an organization.
Your NPS score, in a nutshell, tells you how well your product is loved by users. It helps you segment your users into 3 categories based on how they rate your product out of 10. 
1-6 = Detractors, 7-8 = Passives, 9-10 = Promoters.
CSAT is a more simple score, and can be used to measure how happy users are with individual processes and features. 

* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): Just as monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is the amount of predictable revenue your business earns each month from customers, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is the annualized amount of predictable revenue your company will generate. They’re the amount of revenue you can reasonably predict to be coming in every month and every year.
